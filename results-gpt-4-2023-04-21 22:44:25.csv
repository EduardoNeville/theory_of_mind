    Below is a series of observations, in the order they occurred, followed by a question.  Your job is to analyze the observations carefully and then answer the question. 

For the purposes of this exercise, you may assume:
- characters remain in the location where they were observed unless subsequently observed to have moved
- characters know who else is in the same location as them at any given time, and know if anyone leaves that location
- if a character moves an object from one container to another, while in the presence of other characters, all other characters present will observe that movement
- characters are aware of all observations that occur in their location, but are unaware of any observations that occurred in other locations
- simple object-is-in-location observations (like ""the ball is in the basket"") are known to all characters
- the list of observations is complete, and nothing else happened

Explain your reasoning carefully before giving a final answer as a single lowercase word without punctuation.  You may explain any sources of uncertainty in your reasoning, but always give the most specific possible one-word final answer with your best guess, using the specific vocabulary used in the observations.

Question:
8 Where does Emma think that William searches for the sweatshirt?

Begin.
    ","<reasoning>Emma was present in the den when William entered (1, 2). She then left the den (4) before William moved the sweatshirt from the suitcase to the box (5). Since Emma was not present when William moved the sweatshirt, she is unaware of this action. Therefore, Emma would still think that the sweatshirt is in the suitcase, as that was its last known location to her (3).</reasoning>

Aiden likes the pumpkin (1) and Mila dislikes the socks (7) are not relevant to the question about the trousers. Aiden entered the cellar (2), followed by Mila (3). Mason entered the basement (4), which is a different location from the cellar. The trousers were initially in the drawer (5). Mila exited the cellar (6) before Aiden moved the trousers to the bucket (8). Since Mila was not in the cellar when Aiden moved the trousers, she is unaware of the change in the trousers' location. Aiden exited the cellar (9), and Mila entered the basement (10). Since Mila is unaware of the change in the trousers' location, she will look for them in their last known location, which is the drawer.

Question:
7 Where will Mason look for the celery?

Begin.
    ","<reasoning>
Mason entered the lounge before the celery was observed to be in the bottle. Since characters are aware of all observations that occur in their location, Mason knows that the celery is in the bottle. After Hunter exited the lounge, Mason moved the celery to the bucket. Since no other character was present in the lounge when Mason moved the celery, only Mason knows that the celery is now in the bucket. Amelia entered the lounge after Mason moved the celery, so she is not aware of the celery's current location. Therefore, Mason will look for the celery in the bucket, as he is the one who moved it there and no other character has moved it since.

Question:

    ","<reasoning>
1. Evelyn and Owen were both in the basement at the same time, so they are aware of each other's presence.
2. The shoes were observed to be in the cupboard while both Evelyn and Owen were in the basement. Since they are both aware of simple object-is-in-location observations, they both know the shoes are in the cupboard.
3. Owen left the basement before Evelyn moved the shoes to the bucket. Since characters are unaware of observations that occurred in other locations, Owen does not know that Evelyn moved the shoes.
4. Evelyn knows that Owen left the basement before she moved the shoes, so she would assume that Owen still thinks the shoes are in the cupboard.

Jackson entered the laundry in action 1 and was present when Nathan entered in action 3. Jackson then exited the laundry in action 8.
